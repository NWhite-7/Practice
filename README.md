## Analyzing and Visualizing ACS 2017 Low-Income Data for California

I've analyzed and visualized American Community Survey data many times before, but always by using SPSS and STATA. I downloaded a table I've never used before - "Selected Characteristics of People at Specified Levels of Poverty in the Past 12 Months" - to practice analyzing and visualizing data with Python. I use charts and chi-square tests to examine the following questions: 
* Poverty by County
  * Which counties are the most populous?
  * Which counties have the highest rates of poverty?
  * Do coastal or inland counties have higher rates of poverty, on average?
  * Are these differences statistically significant?
* Poverty by Sex
  * Do males or females have higher rates of poverty, on average?
  * Are these differences statistically significant?
* Poverty by Disability
  * Which counties have the highest rates of disability?
  * Which counties have the highest rates of poverty among the disabled?
  * Do disabled people have similar rates of poverty across different counties?

## Math Practice

In order to get more familiar with Python and its libraries, I practice doing basic math on a randomly generated list using a variety of functions. Each calculation is performed by using easy functions, such as built-in NumPy functions, and by writing my own functions to perform the calculation manually. Using these different functions, I perform the following calculations:
* Calculate median
* Calculate mean
* Calculte minimum value
* Calculate maximum value
* Sort the list
* Calculate specified percentiles
* Add one to each value in the list
